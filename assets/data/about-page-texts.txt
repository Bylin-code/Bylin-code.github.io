If you can’t fix it, rewire it. If you still can’t fix it, call it art. 
That’s how first-grade me justified gutting my brother’s RC car; it's also how I 
tripped into a rabbit hole I’m still falling through. Somewhere 
along the way, making stopped being a thing I did and started being the way I 
saw the world: not as it is, but as it could be, with just a few more wires. 

As an Engineering student at Northwestern, there’s already too many things to chase: 
that pre-AM bedtime, that girl across the chemistry lab bench, that consulting 
club that kept rejecting you.  Point is, sometimes you just can’t find the rabbit, 
no matter how deep you dive, but at least you tried. Great work doesn’t come from perfection; 
it comes from joy, pride, and showing up for your weird ideas even when they hum at 
frequencies only dogs can hear. This site is a living archive of that joy, and maybe, 
if I’m lucky, a spark for yours too.
