intro: "VSNTH is a handheld wooden synthesizer designed for violinists. It features four string buttons and seven fingerboard buttons, mirroring traditional violin tuning and fingering. By pressing combinations, players generate square waves that mimic bowed notes. Two knobs shape the waveformâ€™s timbre.

## Preface
As a classically trained violinist, the culture around the instrument is one of respect to tradition. Sure, you occasionally see an electric violin on America's Got Talent, and another 5 string in a pawn shop somewhere, but it's nowhere near the embrace of technology that the guitar has received. The Violonsynth is a reaction to that: a new way to tickle my brain that thinks in fifths.
