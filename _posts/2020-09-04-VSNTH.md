intro: "VSNTH is a handheld wooden synthesizer designed for violinists. It features four string buttons and seven fingerboard buttons, mirroring traditional violin tuning and fingering. By pressing combinations, players generate square waves that mimic bowed notes. Two knobs shape the waveformâ€™s timbre.

## Preface
As a classically trained violinist, I grew up in a world where tradition ruled. Every now and then you'd spot an electric violin on America's Got Talent or a dusty five-string in a pawn shop, but the instrument has never embraced technology the way, for instance, the guitar has. The Violonsynth is my response to that, a new way to scratch the part of my brain that still thinks in fifths.
