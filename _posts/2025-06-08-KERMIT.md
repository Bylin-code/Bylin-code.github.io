intro: "KERMIT is a frog shaped line-following robot I built for ME433, Advanced Mechatronics. It features an ov7670 camera module as well as two DC motors for differential drive control. KERMIT won 1st place for 'fastest lap' against 60 other student-built bots with a time of 76 seconds."

## Preface
I never thought a simple line following robot would be the source of so much debugging and frustration -- a task so trivial that it's often the default project for middle school robotics classes. This is because of one major constraint: instead of two IR sensors, we had to use a camera.
