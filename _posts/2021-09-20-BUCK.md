intro: "Before PULSE, there was BUCK:a solenoid-actuated robotic percussionist built during my time running my high school's CERAS. With flashing LEDs, precisely timed hits, and a lot of personality packed into a plywood frame, BUCK laid the groundwork for everything that followed. It’s scrappy, it’s loud, and it hits on beat."

## Preface
BUCK wasn’t supposed to work. It was supposed to be a proof-of-concept, a what-if-we-just moment that spiraled out of control in the best way. We were a bunch of high schoolers armed with a pile of solenoids, an unreasonable number of zip ties, and a vision: make a robot that could drum, even if it caught fire doing it.
