intro: "Y3Z is a monophonic, violin-inspired MIDI controller designed for expressive digital performance. Tuned in fifths, it uses four force-sensitive keys for string selection and a soft linear potentiometer as a fingerboard to control pitch bend, vibrato, and slides. Velocity, volume, and pitch are all modulated through nuanced, continuous input."
